# PartyMode
This is my repo for my [Emergency Party Button](https://hacimblog.blogspot.com/2022/02/the-emergency-party-button.html) project. 
There's not really much for anyone here other than my sloppy code and multiple scripts, all essentially to interface with an Arduino spitting out the status of a button via serial. But it's on Github because why not? If someone somehow can use this, or at least be inspired to do the same, then I'm all for it.
